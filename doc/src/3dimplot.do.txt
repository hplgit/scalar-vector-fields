========= Plotting in three dimensions =========

We will explain plotting in three dimensions using three different packages. As with plotting in chapter 5, we will go through Matplotlib and SciTools.
Then we will go through Mayavi, which contains support for doing more advanced plotting operations. The three packages are different in many respects, but they also have much in common, as code below shows.
Note that, for most backends one can plug into Matplotlib/SciTools/Mayavi, one can rotate a figure by holding the mouse cursor down. This functionality is often useful in order to get a better view of a three-dimensional plot.

For Mac OSX and Windows we recommend using Anaconda when testing the plotting packages we describe here. To obtain an environment for this, download the file `inf11003dplot.txt` from the book’s webpage, 
and then create a conda environment named `inf11003dplot` with contents described in this file. This can be done by writing

!bc sys
conda create --name inf11003dplot --file inf11003dplot.txt
!ec 
Then one has to activate the environment. The syntax for this depends on the platform:   

!bc sys
source activate inf11003dplot # Mac OSX platforms
activate inf11003dplot        # Windows platforms
!ec

We will define a surface which we will plot in two different ways, we will make contour plots of it (both in 2D and 3D), plot it together with a parametrised curve on the surface, and plot its gradient vector field. 
We will also consider a two- and a three-dimensional vector field unrelated to a surface. 
Before we start, let us be clear on how variable names have bene chosen. 

* We have used names such as `x`, `y`, `z` for one-dimensional coordinates. 
* We have used names such as `xv`, `yv`, `zv` for (vectorized) coordinates in a higher dimensional grid.
* For vector fields  we use names such as `xv_vec`, `yv_vec`, `zv_vec` for vectors at points corresponding to `xv`, `yv`, `zv`. 

The following goes through the details in our setup.

=== Surface plots ===

We will consider the surface defined by

!bt
\begin{equation}
h(x,y) = \frac{h_0}{1+ \frac{x^2+y^2}{R^2}}. label{heq} 
\end{equation}
!et
$h(x,y)$ models the height of an isolated mountain, where $h$ is the height above sea level, $x$ and $y$ are cartesian coordinates, $h_0$ is the height at the top of the mountain, and $R$ what is called the radius of the mountain.
We will measure $h$ and $h_0$ in meters, and $R$ in kilometers. Prior to all code below we have initialised $h_0$ and $R$ the following values:

!bc pycod
h0 = 2277.
R = 4.
!ec
Prior to plotting the function $h(x,y)$, we need create a grid of the points to plot. Regardless of which plotting package we will use later on, this can be done as follows.

!bc pycod
x = y = np.linspace(-10., 10., 41)
# Grid for contour plot
xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y, indexing='ij', sparse=False)
# indexing='ij' means an $xy$-coordinate system.
# indexing='xy' means coordinates as row/column indices in a matrix. 
hv = h0/(1 + (xv**2 + yv**2)/(R**2)) # Elevation coordinates
!ec
We here defined a grid for the area closer to the mountain top than 10km in any direction.
Note the mysterious extra parameters to `meshgrid` here, which are needed in order for the coordinate axes to have the order we would expect in mathematics.
In Figure ref{plotmatplotlib} we have shown two plots of the surface $h(x,y)$, created with Matplotlib. In Section ref{matplotlibsurfaceplots} we will go through the code which generates these plots.

FIGURE:[images/plotmatplotlib] Two Matplotlib surface plots of $h(x,y)$. Plot without colours (left), and a plot with colours (right) shown together with the parametric curve $\bm{r}(t)$ which is a trajectory to the top of the mountain. label{plotmatplotlib}




=== Parametrized curves ===

We will consider a parametrized curve which lies on the surface, and
which moves with constant angular and radial velocity towards the top of the mountain (i.e. it represents a climb to the top of the mountain). 
You can verify that the following parametrization, with $0\leq t\leq 2\pi$, is such a curve.

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{r}(t) = \left( 10\left(1 - \frac{t}{2\pi}\right)\cos(t),  10\left(1 - \frac{t}{2\pi}\right)\sin(t), \frac{h_0}{1 + \frac{100(1 - t/(2\pi))^2}{R^2}} \right). label{req}
\end{equation}
!et
The coordinates of this parametrized cyrve $\bm{r}(t)$ can be produced as follows.

!bc pycod
s = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
curve_x = 10*(1 - s/(2*np.pi))*np.cos(s)
curve_y = 10*(1 - s/(2*np.pi))*np.sin(s)
curve_z = h0/(1 + 100*(1 - s/(2*np.pi))**2/(R**2))
!ec
The parametric curve is shown together with the surface $h(x,y)$ in the right plot in Figure ref{plotmatplotlib}. 



=== The gradient vector field ===

The gradient vector field of $h(x,y)$ is defined as the vector field which equals the gradient of $h$ at each point.
The gradient of $h(x,y)$ is defined as the vector of partial derivatives.

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla h = (\partial h/\partial x, \partial h \partial y). label{gradienteq}
\end{equation}
!et
In calculus one learns that the gradients are orthogonal to the contour lines. 
This is something we will easily see in our plots when when we combine the contour plot with a plot of the gradient vector field.

When we plot the gradient vector field, it is useful to make a grid of coordinates with a smaller resolution that what we used for the surface coordinates.
The reason is that we will plot many vectors at the same time, and if the resolution is too high the vectors may collide.
For the gradient field $h(x,y)$ we will use half the resolution of the surface coordinates:

!bc pycod
x2 = y2 = np.linspace(-10.,10.,21)
# Grid for vector field
x2v, y2v = np.meshgrid(x2, y2, indexing='ij', sparse=False)
h2v = h0/(1+(x2v**2+y2v**2)/(R**2)) # Elevation coordinates
!ec
The gradient vector field of $h(x,y)$ can now be computed using the function `np.gradient` as follows.

!bc pycod
x2v_vec, y2v_vec = np.gradient(h2v) # The gradient vector (dh/dx,dh/dy)
!ec
The gradient field (ref{gradienteq}), together with the contours of $h(x,y)$ has been plotted with Maplotlib in the right part of Figure ref{quivermatplotlib}. 
In Section ref{matplotlibquiverplots} we will go through the code which generates Figure ref{quivermatplotlib}.

FIGURE:[images/quivermatplotlib, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] Vector field plots with Matplotlib. The two-dimensional vector field (ref{2dvectorfieldeq}) (left), contour plot together with gradient field (ref{gradienteq}) (right). label{quivermatplotlib}


=== A two-dimensional vector field ===

We will consider the following two-dimensional vector field

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{v}(x,y) = \left( x^2 + 2y - \frac{1}{2} xy,   - 3y\right). label{2dvectorfieldeq}
\end{equation}
!et
We will plot this over $[-5,5]$, with $0.5$ distance between the vectors. The grid and the vectors in the field can be obtained as follows.

!bc pycod
x = y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 11)
xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y, sparse=False, indexing='ij')
xv_vec = xv**2 + 2*yv - .5*xv*yv
yv_vec = -3*yv
!ec
The two-dimensional vector field (ref{2dvectorfieldeq}) has been plotted with Matplotlib in the left part of Figure ref{quivermatplotlib}.




=== A three-dimensional vector field ===

As an example of a three-dimensional vector field we will consider a gravitational field.
Newtons law of gravitation says that the gravitational force is proportional to

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{v}(x, y, z) = -\bm{r}/|\bm{r}|^3 = -( x,y,z)/\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}^3, label{3dvectorfieldeq}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\bm{r}=(x,y,z)$ is the position vector. We first need to create a three-dimensional grid and the vectors in the field as follows.

!bc pycod
x = y = z = np.linspace(.5, 2., 8)
xv, yv, zv = np.meshgrid(x, y, z)
r3 = np.sqrt(xv**2 + yv**2 + zv**2)**3
xv_vec = -x/r3
yv_vec = -y/r3
zv_vec = -z/r3
!ec
The cube of the distance (`r3`) has here been computed once, since all three components are divided by this.
Also we compute the vector field for a section in the first octant only, where all three components are between $0.5$ and $2$, 
and we do not make the grid too dense, so that individual vectors have smaller chance of colliding. 
The three-dimensional vector field (ref{3dvectorfieldeq}) has been plotted with Matplotlib in Figure ref{quivermatplotlibgr}.
The code which generates Figure ref{quivermatplotlibgr} is also gone through in Section ref{matplotlibquiverplots}.

FIGURE:[images/quivermatplotlibgr, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] The three-dimensional vector field (ref{3dvectorfieldeq}) plotted with Matplotlib. label{quivermatplotlibgr}













======= Matplotlib =======

Below we will use the prefix `plt` for the package `matplotlib.pyplot`:

!bc pycod
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
!ec
Note that with Matplotlib, after each plot command you need to write `plt.show()` in order for the new plot to become visible. When we make a plot in 2D we need to first write the following

!bc pycod
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca()
!ec
The returned object `ax` can the be used for the calls to the different plotting functions, as is examplified below. 
If we instead want to make a plot in 3D we also need to import an additional package for this, and change the way we get the object `ax` as follows.

!bc pycod
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
!ec




===== Simple surface plots label{matplotlibsurfaceplots} =====

Simple surface plots of $h(x,y)$ in (ref{heq}) (uncoloured, and coloured together with the parametric curve $\bm{r}(t)$ in (ref{req})) can be produced as follows. 

!bc pycod
# Used to obtain a color map which can be used to color the surface.
# One can choose from a wide range of different color maps:
from matplotlib import cm

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
ax.plot_surface(xv, yv, hv)

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
ax.plot_surface(xv, yv, hv, cmap=cm.coolwarm)
ax.plot(curve_x, curve_y, curve_z) # Plot of parametrised curve
!ec
Per default the plots are done into the same figure. This is why the parametrised curve ended up in the same figure as the surface plot preceding it. 
Above coloring can be used to get a better view of surfaces. The resulting plots were shown in Figure ref{plotmatplotlib}.






===== Contour plots =====

The following code examplifies how one can create different types of contour plots.

!bc pycod
# Default two-dimensional contour plot: with X contour lines
ax.contour(xv, yv, hv)

# Default three-dimensional contour plot
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
ax.contour(xv, yv, hv)

# 10 contour lines. The contour levels will be automatically chosen.
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca()
ax.contour(xv, yv, hv, 10)

# 10 contour lines. Black color for contour lines
ax.contour(xv, yv, hv, 10, colors='k')

# Specify the contour levels
levels = [500., 1000., 1500., 2000.]
ax.contour(xv, yv, hv, levels=levels)

# Add labels with the contour line values to the lines
c = ax.contour(xv, yv, hv, levels=levels)
plt.clabel(c)
!ec
The first two plots (default two-dimensional and three-dimensional contour plots) are shown in Figure ref{simplecontourmatplotlib}. The next 4 plots are shown in Figure ref{advancedcontourmatplotlib}.

FIGURE:[images/simplecontourmatplotlib, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8]  Default two-dimensional (left) and three-dimensional (right) contour plots with Matplotlib. label{simplecontourmatplotlib}

FIGURE:[images/advancedcontourmatplotlib, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] Some other contour plots with Matplotlib: With 10 contour lines (upper left), with 10 contour lines in black (upper right), with specified levels (lower left), and with labeled levels (lower right). label{advancedcontourmatplotlib}





===== Vector field plots label{matplotlibquiverplots} =====

The following code plots the two-dimensional vector field (ref{2dvectorfieldeq}), the gradient field (ref{gradienteq}) together with contours, and finally the three-dimensional vector field (ref{3dvectorfieldeq}).

!bc pycod
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca()
# angles and scale_units express that the vector field should be 
# drawn as a gradient field, i.e. that the length of the vectors 
# equals their actual length. 
# color indicates the colour to be used for the vectors (here blue).


ax.quiver(xv, yv, xv_vec, yv_vec, angles='xy', scale_units='xy', \
          color='b')

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca()
ax.quiver(x2v, y2v, x2v_vec, y2v_vec, color='r', angles='xy')
ax.contour(xv, yv, hv)

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
ax.quiver(xv, yv, zv, xv_vec, yv_vec, zv_vec, color='r', length=0.2)
!ec
The first two plots were shown in Figure ref{quivermatplotlib}, and the third was shown in Figure ref{quivermatplotlibgr}.
Often the vectors need to be scaled in order for them not to collide in the plot (alternatively one can have some more distance between the points in the arrays `x` and `y`.
This can be done manually by using the `scale` parameter. Increasing this results in shorter vectors.
Matplotlib will attempt to scale the plot automatically if the `scale` parameter is not set, in order to try to avoid that the vectors collide.









======= SciTools =======

Most of the SciTools plots below have been generated with the default backend of SciTools, which is Matplotlib in the most recent versions of SciTools. 
In some cases a gnuplot backend had to be used. This has been mentioned in comments in the code in those cases.

Below we will use the prefix `plt` for the package `scitools.easyviz`:

!bc pycod
import scitools.easyviz as plt
!ec



===== Simple surface plots =====

SciTools has the function `ndgrid` which, just as `meshgrid`, can be used to create grids of all possible $(x,y)$-coordinate pairs from given one-dimensional coordinates.
One can simply replace the calls to `meshgrid` above with

!bc pycod
xv, yv = plt.ndgrid(x, y)     # Grid for contour plot
x2v, y2v = plt.ndgrid(x2, y2) # Grid for quiver plot
!ec
`ndgrid` is more flexible than `meshgrid` in the sense that it can be used to make three-dimensional grids also. Also, we see that the extra parameters `indexing` and `sparse` do not need to be set: 
They attain default values which can be used.
The simple surface plots of $h(x,y)$ in (ref{heq}) (uncoloured, and coloured together with the parametric curve $\bm{r}(t)$ in (ref{req})) can now be produced as follows. 

!bc pycod
plt.mesh(xv, yv, hv) # Gnuplot backend

plt.surf(xv, yv, hv) # Gnuplot backend
plt.hold(‘on’)
plt.plot3(curve_x, curve_y, curve_z, 'r-') # Gnuplot backend
!ec
The results are shown in Figure ref{plotscitools}. 

FIGURE:[images/plotscitools, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] Two SciTools surface plots. Plot without colours (left), and a plot with colours (right) shown together with a parametric curve which is a trajectory to the top of the mountain. label{plotscitools}


===== Contour plots =====

The following code examplifies how one can create the same types of contour plots as above with SciTools. As is seen, there are only minor differences in how the parameters (colour, levels, labeling) to the plot are set.

!bc pycod
# Default two-dimensional contour plot: with X contour lines
plt.contour(xv, yv, hv)

# Default three-dimensional contour plot (Gnuplot backend)
plt.contour3(xv, yv, hv)

# 10 contour lines. The contour levels will be automatically chosen.
plt.contour(xv, yv, hv, 10)

# 10 contour lines. Black color for contour lines
plt.contour(xv, yv, hv, 10, 'k')

# Specify the contour levels
levels = [500., 1000., 1500., 2000.]
plt.contour(xv, yv, hv, levels)

# Add labels with the contour line values to the lines
plt.contour(xv, yv, hv, levels, clabels='on')
!ec
The first two plots (default two-dimensional and three-dimensional contour plots) are shown in Figure ref{simplecontourscitools}. The next 4 plots are shown in Figure ref{advancedcontourscitools}.

FIGURE:[images/simplecontourscitools, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8]  Default two-dimensional (left) and three-dimensional (right) contour plots with SciTools. label{simplecontourscitools}

FIGURE:[images/advancedcontourscitools, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] Some other contour plots with SciTools: With 10 contour lines (upper left), with 10 contour lines in black (upper right), with specified levels (lower left), and with labeled levels (lower right). label{advancedcontourscitools}


===== Vector field plots =====

There seems to be limited supported for plotting three-dimensional vector fields in SciTools (the function is called `contour3`), so the following code only concerns the gradient field (ref{gradienteq}) and the two-dimensional vector field (ref{2dvectorfieldeq}).

!bc pycod
# The two last parameters represent scaling (0 means no scaling) 
# and color (‘b’ means blue).
plt.quiver(xv, yv, xv_vec, yv_vec, 200, 'b')

plot.figure()
plt.quiver(x2v, y2v, x2v_vec, y2v_vec, 0, 'r')
plt.hold('on')
plt.contour(x, y, h, daspectmode='equal')
!ec
The results are shown in Figure ref{quiverscitools}.

FIGURE:[images/quiverscitools, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] Vector field plots with SciTools. The two-dimensional vector field (left), contour plot together with gradient field (right). label{quiverscitools}







======= Mayavi =======

Mayavi[^mayaviurl] is an advanced, free, easy to use, scientific data visualizer, with an emphasis on 3D visualization.
It is written in Python, and uses the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for rendering graphics. Since VTK can be configured with different backends, so can Mayavi.
Mayavi is cross platform and runs on most platforms, including Mac OSX, Windows, Linux. 
On Ubuntu you can install Mayavi by writing or `sudo apt-get install mayavi2`, or  `sudo pip install mayavi —upgrade` (which will obtain the most recent version of it).

[^mayaviurl]: The page URL: "http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/" collects pointers to all relevant documentation or Mayavi

We will only consider the Mayavi’s functionality for simple plotting[^simpleplotting], such as the functionality we considered for Matplotlib and SciTools.
The `mayavi.mlab` module provides a simple interface to such plotting, with an emphasis on 3D visualization.
Below we will use the prefix `plt` for the package `mayavi.mlab`:

!bc pycod
import mayavi.mlab as plt
!ec
Several of the functions in `mlab` have the same name as the counterparts in SciTools and Matplotlib, so it is smart to separate them using prefixes.

[^simpleplotting]: The documentation for simple plotting functions can also be found on URL: "http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/auto/mlab_helper_functions.html". Further documentation can be found on URL: "http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/auto/mlab_other_functions.html".



===== The basics =====

We first need to cover some of the basic figure handling functions in the `mayavi.mlab` module[^basicfigurehandling].
Much of this is similar to the bascis for Matplotlib and SciTools, and we will therefore try to focus mainly on the differences.

[^basicfigurehandling]: The documentation for basic figure handling functions can be found on URL: "http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/auto/mlab_figure.html"


Just as in Matplotlib, the plotting commands you do in `mlab` will go into the same figure, until you change to a new figure. 
The following code explains the use of some of the basic figure handling functions together with a simple surface plot.

!bc pycod
plt.clf() # Clear current figure, and return a handle to it.

# Create a figure with white background, black foreground
# Colours are represented as RGB-values, where the components
# are floating points between zero and one.
plt.figure(fgcolor=(.0, .0, .0), bgcolor=(1.0, 1.0, 1.0))

plt.mesh(xv, yv, hv, extent=(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1))
plt.title('My first plot') # Decorate the current figure  with a title.

# Create axes with given labels, 5 ticks on each axis, and given color
plt.axes(xlabel='x', ylabel='y', zlabel='z', nb_labels=5, \
         color=(0., 0., 0.))

# Save current figure to file. File type is deduced from the extension
plt.savefig('plot.png')
plt.close() # Close the current figure
!ec
There is no function `plt.show()` in Mayavi. Instead the current figure is made visible by default.
The functions `clf()`, `close()`, `figure()`, `savefig()` all can take an optional parameter which identifies the figure in question (this parameter was not used above). 
Also, a figure can be identified or created in terms of a name, an index, or the figure object itself.
The following code shows how one can jump between figures, to create different plots.
!bc pycod
fig = plt.gcf()        # Return the current figure object

# Set figure with index 1 to be the current one.
# It is created if it does not exist.
plt.figure(1)

# Set figure with name 'New plot' to be the current one.
plt.figure('New plot')

# Set the previously retrieved figure again to be the current one,
# and set the foreground and background colour.
plt.figure(fig, fgcolor=(.0, .0, .0), bgcolor=(1.0, 1.0, 1.0))
!ec
If there exists no figure with the given name or index, `plt.figure()` will create a new one.
The function `plt.gcf()` returns the current figure object. You will need to call this in order to change the properties of the current figure,
such as the foreground or background colour above. Note that the foreground colour is used for text and labels included in the plot.

===== Simple surface plots =====

Above we called the function `mesh` to make a simple surface plot of the $h(x,y)$ in (ref{heq}). This works similarly to Matplotlib and SciTools, but note the extra parameter `extent=(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)`. 
Mayavi does no auto-scaling of the axes per default (contrary to SciTools and Matplotlib), 
so if the magnitudes in the vertical and horizontal directions are very different (as they are for $h(x,y)$), the plots may be very concentrated in one direction.
`extent` ensures that the axes are auto-scaled to fit the contents of the surface. 
We will return to what the six values listed in `extent` mean.

To reproduce the coloured surface plot together with the parametric curve $\bm{r}(t)$ in (ref{req}), we can write

!bc pycod
plt.surf(xv, yv, hv, extent=(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1))
plt.plot3d(curve_x, curve_y, curve_z, tube_radius=0.2, \
           extent=(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1))
# tube_radius controls the width of the parametrized curve.
# Increased here in order to make the curve more visible 
# when shown together with `surf`.
!ec
`surf` is more general than `mesh` according to the documentation, but for this plot we really see no differences.
Figure ref{plotmayavi} shows the resulting plots. 
Rather unexpectedly we see that $\bm{r}(t)$ does not lie on the surface anymore. 
The reason is that the ranges of the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-values differ for the the curve and the surface, so that autoscaling will use different scales when placing them on the scene.
We therefore have to be a bit cautious when applying the autoscaling in Mayavi, and in the following contour plots we will avoid this autoscaling problem by scaling everything
first so that the coordinates are of comparable magnitude, so that there is no need for autoscaling in the first case. 
One can also use other properties to scale the cases. Some of the plotting commands below accept a `warp_scale` parameter, which tells us how the the vertical scaling should be performed.

FIGURE:[images/plotmayavi] Two Mayavi surface plots. Using `mesh` (left), and using `surf` (right) together with a parametric curve which is a trajectory to the top of the mountain. label{plotmayavi}



===== Subplots =====

The two plots in Figure ref{plotmayavi} were created as separate figures. One can also create them as subplots within one figure, so that one figure is generated with several subplots.
Consider the following code.

!bc pycod
plt.outline(plt.mesh(xv, yv, hv, extent=(0, 0.25, 0, 0.25, 0, 0.25),\
            color=(.5, .5, .5)))
plt.outline(plt.mesh(xv, yv, hv, \
            extent=(0.375, 0.625, 0, 0.25, 0, 0.25),\
            colormap='Accent'))
plt.outline(plt.mesh(xv, yv, hv, extent=(0.75, 1, 0, 0.25, 0, 0.25),\
            colormap='prism'))
!ec
The result is shown in the left plot in Figure ref{subplot}.


FIGURE:[images/subplot] A plot with three subplots created with Mayavi, consisting of the same surface drawn with different color maps. label{subplot}

From this it should be clear that the six values listed in `extent` represent fractions of the cube `(0,1,0,1,0,1)`, where the corresponding plots are placed.
The extents for the three plots are defined so that they do not overlap.
Three separate `mesh` commands are run, each producing a new plot in the current figure.
The handles to the three plots are stored in the variables `surf1`, `surf2`, and `surf3`, and
the function `outline` finally draws the corresponding box for the plot in question. We have dropped the axes and the title in the code here.

Note that the surfaces in Figure ref{subplot} are drawn with different colors. This is due to the `colormap` and `color` attributes in the call to `mesh`, which adjusts the colors when the surface is drawn. 
The `color` attribute, which we see also can be used as a parameter to `outline`, 
adjusts the surface so that it is coloured with small variations from the provided base-color.
One can choose from a wide range of different color maps.


===== Contour plots =====

The following code examplifies how one can create the same types of contour plots as above with Mayavi. We see again some minor differences, such as how colors here are specified by value.

!bc pycod
plt.contour_surf(xv, yv, hv)        # default: with X contour lines.

There seems to be no function in Mayavi which labels the contours, as we did with Matplotlib and ScitTools. 
The plots are shown in Figure ref{advancedcontourmayavi}. Contour plots in Mayavi are shown in 3D, contrary to Matplotlib and SciTools. Their visual appearance may be enhanced by also including the surface plot itself. We have here done this for two of the contour plots.
For comparison, we have not included the surface itself for the two last contour plots. There is a clear difference in visual impression between the two, and we see that the colour of the contours can conflict with the colour of the surface.

===== Plotting vector fields in 3D =====

Mayavis functionality for plotting vector fields is primarily intended for 3D also, so we will only plot the three dimensional field (ref{3dvectorfieldeq}).
This can be vizualized as follows.

!bc pycod
# Set foreground/background colour
plt.figure(fgcolor=(.0, .0, .0), bgcolor=(1.0, 1.0, 1.0))
plt.quiver3d(xv, yv, zv, xv_vec, yv_vec, zv_vec, \
            mode='arrow', colormap='jet', scale_factor=.5)
# First three parameters are the points where vectors are drawn
# Next three parameters are the actual components of the vectors
# mode: ensures that the vectors are drawn as arrow.
# colormap: controls how the vectors are colored.
# scale_factor: manually scale vector lengths, 
# so that vectors do not collide.
plt.axes(xlabel='x', ylabel='y', zlabel='z', \
        nb_labels=5, color=(0., 0., 0.))

!ec
The resulting plot is shown in Figure ref{quivermayavi}. This shows some of the challenges in plotting three-dimensional vector fields. 
It may be challenging to create instructive plots, since vectors are drawn over an area in 3D rather than 2D.

===== Animations =====


We have previously seen how to produce animations with Matplotlib and SciTools.
With the function `animate` in `mlab` we can also create animations.



This code will rotate the camera continuously. f is the current graphics.

!bc pycod
import mayavi as plt
@mlab.animate
def anim():
    f = plt.gcf()
    while 1:
        f.scene.camera.azimuth(10)
        f.scene.render()
        plt.yield

a = anim()
