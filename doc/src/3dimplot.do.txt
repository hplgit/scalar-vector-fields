========= Plotting in three dimensions =========

We will explain plotting in three dimensions using three different packages. As with plotting in chapter 5 we will go through matplotlib and scitools. 
Then we will go through Mayavi, which contain support for doing more advanced plotting operations. 

The three packages are different in many respects, but there are some common denominators. First of all, they all support rotation of a figure by holding the mouse cursor down. 
This functionality is often useful in order to get a better view of a surface. 

======= Matplotlib =======
The code below assumes that we have imported matplotlib as in chapter 5, i.e. that we use the prefix `plt` for matplotlib code:
!bc pycod
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
!ec
Note that after each plot command you need to write `plt.show()` in order for the new plot to become visible.  

=== Curve plots in 3D ===
A parametrized curve can be plotted in 3D as follows
!bc pycod
t = np.linspace(0, 10*np.pi, 100)

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection = '3d')
ax.plot(np.sin(t), np.cos(t), t)
!ec
The resulting plot is shown in Figure ref{parametrizedcurvematplotlib}
FIGURE:[images/parametrizedcurvematplotlib, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] A parametrized curve plotted with matplotlib. label{parametrizedcurvematplotlib}

=== Simple surface plots ===
Let us start by plotting a surface $z=f(x,y)$ over an interval in the $xy$-plane. We first need to create a two-dimensional grid of values covering such an interval. A grid for the interval $[-4,4]\times[-2,2]$ 
can be created as follows.
!bc pycod
x = np.arange(-4, 4, 0.05, float)
y = np.arange(-2, 2, 0.05, float)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y, sparse = False, indexing = 'ij')
!ec
This code sets `X` and `Y` to be coordinates so that all pairs $(x,y)$ constitute a grid covering the entire interval in the $xy$-plane.
Note the mysterious extra parameters to `meshgrid` here, which are needed in order for the coordinate axes to have the order we would expect in mathematics. 

Now that we have the grid coordinates, we need to create the corresponding function values. For the function $z=f(x,y)=xy\sin(xy)$, this can be done as follows  
!bc pycod
Z = X*Y*sin(X*Y)
!ec

The surface can now be plotted as follows:
!bc pycod
fig = plt.figure() 
ax = fig.gca(projection = '3d')
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z)
!ec
The resul is shown in the left plot in Figure ref{plotmatplotlib}
FIGURE:[images/plotmatplotlib, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] Two matplotlib surface plots. Simple plot (left), and a plot with colours (right). label{plotmatplotlib}

=== Coloring ===
Coloring can be used to get a better view of surfaces. We can use the `cm`-module to obtain a color map which can be used to color the surface. 
!bc pycod
from matplotlib import cm
!ec
This can then be passed to the `plot_surface` function above as follows: 
!bc pycod
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap = cm.coolwarm)
!ec
The result is shown in the right plot in Figure ref{plotmatplotlib}. One can choose from a wide range of different color maps. 

=== Contour plots ===
In order to create a simple contour plot we can write the following
!bc pycod 
plt.contour(X, Y, Z)
!ec
The resulting plot is shown in Figure ref{simplecontourmatplotlib}
FIGURE:[images/simplecontourmatplotlib, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] A simple matplotlib contour plot. label{simplecontourmatplotlib}

By adding a parameter we can specify how many contour levels to plot. The contour levels will be automatically chosen.
!bc pycod 
plt.contour(X, Y, Z, 10)
!ec
The result is shown in the upper left plot of Figure ref{advancedcontourmatplotlib}.
FIGURE:[images/advancedcontourmatplotlib, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] Some other matplotlib contour plots: With 10 levels (upper left), with 10 levels in black (upper right), with specified levels (lower left), and with labeled levels (lower right). label{advancedcontourmatplotlib}

Normally the level curves are drawn with different colours. This is very useful on the display, but is less practical if you want to paste the figure into a black and white document. 
If you write
!bc pycod
plt.contour(X, Y, Z, 10, colors = 'k')
!ec
The result is shown in the upper right plot of Figure ref{advancedcontourmatplotlib}. All level curves will be drawn in black ('k' is the symbol for black). 

The automatically chosen levels above may not be the most interesting level curves, or may not be the levels we are interested in. We can specify which levels to include in the contour plot as follows. 
!bc pycod
levels = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels = levels)
!ec
The result is shown in the lower left plot of Figure ref{advancedcontourmatplotlib}

The levels in a contour plot are not labeled with the corresponding values by default. To include a default kind of labeling of the levels, one can call the `clabel` function.
!bc pycod
cs = plt.contour(X, Y, Z)
plt.clabel(cs)
!ec
The result is shown in the lower right plot in Figure ref{advancedcontourmatplotlib}

=== Plotting vector fields ===
Let us attempt to plot the vector field 
$${\bf v} = \left( x^2 + 2y - \frac{1}{2} xy \right){\bf i}  - 3y{\bf j}.$$
If we want to plot this over $[-5,5]$, with $0.5$ distance between the vectors, we first need to create a two-dimensional grid as follows. 
!bc pycod 
t = np.linspace(-5, 5, 11)
x, y = np.meshgrid(t, t, sparse = False, indexing = 'ij')
vx = x**2 + 2*y - .5*x*y
vy = -3*y
!ec
The following code 
!bc pycod
plt.quiver(x, y, vx, vy, angles = 'xy', scale_units = 'xy', color = 'b')
!ec
plots the vector field. 
The two first parameters specify the $x$- and $y$-components of the points where vectors are to be drawn, and the next two parameters the actual components of the vectors.
The resulting plot is shown in Figure ref{quivermatplotlib}
FIGURE:[images/quivermatplotlib, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] A vector field plotted with matplotlib. label{quivermatplotlib}

The parameters `angles` and `scale_units` say that the vector field should be drawn as a gradient field, i.e. that the length of the vectors coincide with that of the vector ${\bf v}$. 
`color` indicates the colour to be used for the vectors (here blue). 
Often the vectors need to be scaled in order for them not to collide in the plot (alternatively one can have some more distance between the points in the arrays `x` and `y`. 
This can be done manually by using the `scale` parameter. Increasing this results in shorter vectors. 
Matplotlib will attempt to scale the plot automatically if the `scale` parameter is not set, in order to try to avoid that the vectors collide.



======= Scitools =======
The code below assumes that we have imported scitools as in chapter 5: 
!bc pycod
from scitools.easyviz import *
!ec

=== Curve plots in 3D ===
TODO

=== Simple surface plots ===
Scitools has the function `ndgrid` which, just as `meshgrid`, can be used to create grids of all possible $(x,y)$-coordinate pairs from given one-dimensional coordinates.
One can simply replace the call to `meshgrid` above with  
!bc pycod
X, Y = ndgrid(x, y)
!ec
`ndgrid` is more flexible than `meshgrid` in the sense that it can be used to make three-dimensional grids also. 

The surface can now be plotted simply by writing `mesh(X, Y, Z)`, so that this part of the code is shorter than the three lines needed with matplotlib.
The result is shown in the left plot in Figure ref{plotscitools}.
FIGURE:[images/plotscitools, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] Two scitools surface plots. Simple plot (left), and a plot with colours (right). label{plotscitools}

=== Coloring ===
We can write `surf(X, Y, Z)` instead of `mesh(X, Y, Z)` to get a graph where the surface elements have been coloured. 
The result is shown in the right plot in Figure ref{simpleplotcoloursscitools}. One can choose from a wide range of different color maps. 

=== Contour plots ===
In order to create a simple contour plot we can write the following
!bc pycod 
contour(X, Y, Z)
!ec
The resulting plot is shown in Figure ref{simplecontourscitools}
FIGURE:[images/simplecontourscitools, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] A simple scitools contour plot. label{simplecontourscitools}

By adding a parameter we can specify how many contour levels to plot. The contour levels will be automatically chosen.
!bc pycod
contour(X, Y, Z, 10)
!ec
The result is shown in the upper left plot in Figure ref{advancedcontourscitools}.
FIGURE:[images/advancedcontourscitools, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] Some other scitools contour plots: With 10 levels (upper left), with 10 levels in black (upper right), with specified levels (lower left), and with labeled levels (lower right). label{advancedcontourscitools}

Normally the level curves are drawn with different colours. This is very useful on the display, but is less practical if you want to paste the figure into a black and white document. If you write
!bc pycod
contour(X, Y, Z, 10, 'k')
!ec
all level curves will be drawn in black ('k' is the symbol for black). 
The result is shown in the upper right plot in Figure ref{advancedcontourscitools}.

The automatically chosen levels above may not be the most interesting level curves, or may not be the levels we are interested in. We can specify which levels to include in the contour plot as follows. 
!bc pycod
levels = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
contour(X, Y, Z, levels = levels)
!ec
The result is shown in the lower left plot in Figure ref{contourspeclevelsscitools}.

The levels in a contour plot are not labeled with the corresponding values by default. To include a default kind of labeling of the levels, one can use a parameter called `clabels`.
!bc pycod
contour(X, Y, Z, clabels = 'on')
!ec
The result is shown in the lower right plot in Figure ref{contourclabelscitools}.

=== Plotting vector fields ===
Let ur return to the vector field
$${\bf v} = \left( x^2 + 2y - \frac{1}{2} xy \right){\bf i}  - 3y{\bf j},$$
and let us reuse the code above to produce the vectors in the vector field. With scitools one can instead write
!bc pycod
quiver(x, y, vx, vy, 200, 'b')
!ec
##TODO: I need to consult the documentation here
to plot the vector field. The resulting plot is shown in Figure ref{quiverscitools}
FIGURE:[images/quiverscitools, height=400 width=600 frac=0.8] The vector field from figure ref{quivermatplotlib} plotted with scitools. label{quiverscitools}

The two last parameters represent scaling and color.
